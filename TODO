Note this project used to work on Netlify using a CORS proxy. This no longer works even using an alternate proxy. It still works locally though.
This may never work remotely as the API does not want to allow cross origin requests (consumption by other services)


Alternate approaches to get data

$.ajax({ url: API_QUERY_URL, crossDomain: true }).then(result => console.log(result));

$.getJSON({
     url: API_QUERY_URL,
     headers: {
         "accept": "application/json",
         "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
     }
 }).then(result => console.log(result));
